# godot-template
Template for making a new blank Godot project. Includes continuous integration by default for Windows, Mac, Linux (X11), and Web. For Web exports the CI creates a new page on Github Pages, with the game running on it.

Uses [github-ci](https://github.com/abarichello/godot-ci) by default.
